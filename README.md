## 🌟 Project Overview

This portfolio serves as a central hub for a developer's professional identity. It features a responsive hero section, a categorized skill matrix, and a dynamic project grid. The design prioritizes clarity, high contrast for readability, and a streamlined contact flow for potential collaborators.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this interface allowed me to deepen my expertise in several critical areas of modern frontend engineering:

- **Art Direction with HTML5:** I implemented the `picture` element to serve different image versions based on device width. This ensures optimal loading times plus visual quality across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Semantic Architecture:** I prioritized tags such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `section`. This choice directly improves SEO plus makes the site navigable for users relying on screen readers.
- **Typography Systems:** I integrated the Space Grotesk font family, managing font weights from 300 to 700 to create a clear visual hierarchy.
- **Form Design:** I built a functional contact section using semantic input types, ensuring a clean data entry path for users.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Utilized for semantic markup plus accessible structure.
- **CSS3:** Managed through external stylesheets for clean separation of concerns.
- **Google Fonts:** Integration of the Space Grotesk typeface for a modern aesthetic.
- **Responsive Web Design:** Implemented through media queries plus the `picture` tag.
